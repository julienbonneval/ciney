# Ciney-WS

Ciney is a search engine specialized in movie and actors.
I made this website with a team of 6 during a project of web semantic in my 4th year of computer science school at INSA Lyon.

The goal of this project was to use sparql and understand how RDF triples works.
We had to write sparql request to ask the DBpedia and WikiData databases through their API.

To see the project download it by cloning the repository and open the index.html file in you favorite browser.
